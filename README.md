## Project Description

This project is a Vietnamese eBook website designed to provide a comprehensive and user-friendly platform for reading and managing eBooks. The website includes several advanced features aimed at enhancing the reading experience and facilitating efficient study and research.

## Key Features

- Built-in Editor for Note-Taking: Easily annotate and take notes directly within the eBooks. Notes are saved and can be accessed anytime.
- Semantic Search: Utilize advanced vector-based search technology to find books and content semantically, ensuring more accurate and relevant search results. (not yet)
- Highly Customizable UI: Tailor the user interface to your preferences with various customization options, making the reading experience more comfortable and personalized.
- Share Books and Notes: Share your favorite books and notes with others easily. (not yet)

## Project Status

This project was developed over the course of approximately one week and, while functional, it is not yet complete. (Also first time learning Next.js so spaghetti code is expected. I might finish it and add more features in the future)

## Inspiration

The inspiration for this project stemmed from a need to crawl a large number of Vietnamese books for an NLP (Natural Language Processing) project. During this process, I noticed a lack of free, aesthetically pleasing, and functional reading websites for Vietnamese books. This realization drove the creation of this project, aiming to fill that gap and provide a valuable resource for Vietnamese readers and researchers.
